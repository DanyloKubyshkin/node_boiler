## **Node.js Express Boilerplate: Best Practices for Project Structure**

**Purpose**

This boilerplate repository offers a well-structured and scalable foundation for Node.js Express projects, emphasizing industry best practices in folder architecture and file organization.  While it does not provide a functional implementation, it serves as a valuable starting point for building robust and maintainable applications.

**Key Principles**

* **Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns into logical folders for enhanced maintainability.
* **Scalability:** A structure designed to accommodate project growth and evolving complexity.
* **Best Practices:** Adherence to established Node.js and Express conventions for a familiar development experience. 
* **Documentation:** Emphasis on thorough explanations within each folder to promote understanding.

**Project Structure Overview**

* **root directory**
    * **docker/**  - Docker configuration for containerizing the application. [docker.md](/docker/docker.md) - Detailed instructions and documentation for using Docker with this project. 
    * **docs/** - Project knowledge base and development documentation. [docs.md](/docs/docs.md) - Detailed instructions and documentation for using this project.
    * **scripts/** -  Custom scripts for development, deployment, and utilities. [scripts.md](/scripts/scripts.md) - Detailed instructions and documentation for using scripts.
    * **src/** - The core source code of the application. [src.md](/src/src.md) - Detailed instructions and documentation for using the source code.
    * **test/** -  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. [test.md](/test/test.md) - Detailed instructions and documentation for running tests.
    * **.editorconfig:**  Specifies basic code editor settings (indentation style, line endings, etc.). This ensures code looks the same regardless of the editor used by individual developers.
    * **.eslintignore:**  Indicates files and directories that should be excluded from ESLint's code quality checks. 
    * **.eslintrc:**  The core configuration file for ESLint.  It defines the JavaScript linting rules and stylistic preferences enforced in the project.
    * **.gitattributes:** Allows customization of how Git handles certain files within your repository (e.g., specifying line endings, merge strategies).
    * **.gitignore:**  Lists files and patterns to prevent accidental committing of development artifacts, sensitive data, or large generated files to version control.
    * **.npmignore:**  Similar to `.gitignore` but specifically for npm packaging. It controls what's excluded when publishing your project as an npm module.
    * **.npmrc:**  Contains configuration options for the npm package manager. This can be used for setting registry URLs, proxy settings, and other npm behaviors.
    * **.nvmrc:** Specifies a Node.js version for the project. Using Node Version Manager (nvm) helps ensure all developers use the same version, preventing compatibility issues.
    * **.prettierrc:** Configures the Prettier code formatter with preferred formatting rules (semicolons, spacing, quotes, etc.).  This promotes code style homogeneity within the project.
    * **.snyk:** Likely used for Snyk dependency vulnerability scanning. This file holds configuration options related to integrating Snyk into your development workflow.
    * **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:** Guidelines for community interaction and collaboration.
    * **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Instructions for contributing to the project.
    * **LICENSE:**  The license governing the use and distribution of the project.
    * **README.md:**  Overview of the project, its structure, and key files.
    * **package.json:**  Metadata and dependencies for the Node.js project.
    * **package-lock.json:** Lock file automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree or `package.json`.


**Getting Started**

2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Review and customize configuration files as needed.
4. Refer to the documentation within each folder for guidance on how to build out your application.


**Run tests**

1. Run `npm test` to execute all tests.
