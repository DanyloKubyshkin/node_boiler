# **Purpose**

The `scripts` folder houses various custom scripts written in Bash, Python, or other suitable languages. These scripts serve to streamline development processes, automate common tasks, and aid in production operations for our Express.js project.

**Types of Scripts You Might Find Here**

* **Development Workflow:**
    * **linting.sh:** Enforce code style and maintain consistency.
    * **test_runner.py:** Execute unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
    * **start_dev_server.sh:**  Spin up a development server with hot reloading.
    * **database_seed.py:** Populate development databases with test data.

* **Deployment:**
    * **build_production.sh:** Bundle, minify, and optimize production assets.  
    * **database_migrations.sh:** Apply database schema changes.
    * **provision_environment.py:** (If applicable) Automate infrastructure setup.

* **Utilities:**
    * **data_cleanup.py:** Cleanse or transform datasets.
    * **report_generator.sh:**  Generate project health reports or metrics.  
    * **boilerplate.sh:** Create boilerplate code for common components.

**Organization**

**We should consider creating subfolders within `scripts` to categorize tasks** (e.g., `dev`, `build`, `deploy`, `utilities`) **if we anticipate a large number of scripts.** This will help us keep things organized and make it easier to find the script we need.  **Let's also maintain clear and descriptive naming conventions for individual script files.** This will make it obvious what each script does, even for someone who is new to the project.

**Usage**

**package.json:**  For convenient execution of frequently used scripts, we can integrate them into our `package.json` file.  By adding entries under the "scripts" section (e.g., `"scripts": {"lint": "npm run lint", "test": "npm run test"}`), we create easy-to-remember commands (like `npm run lint`) to trigger these scripts from the command line. This approach benefits everyone on the team by establishing a standardized way to run essential scripts.

**CI/CD Pipeline:**  As our project evolves, we can leverage continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices to automate script execution within the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that critical tasks, such as testing or building production assets, are consistently performed during the development lifecycle, regardless of who makes code changes.  This fosters a more robust and reliable development process.

**Documentation**

Maintaining well-documented scripts is crucial for effective collaboration and knowledge sharing within a team. Here are some tips for adding valuable documentation to your scripts:

* **Internal Script Comments:** Include clear and concise comments within the script itself to explain its purpose, usage, and any assumptions or dependencies. This helps developers understand the script's logic and how it interacts with other parts of the project.
* **External Documentation (Optional):**  For complex or reusable scripts, consider creating a separate markdown file (e.g., `script_name.md`) alongside the script. This file can provide a more detailed explanation of the script's functionality, including:
    * A comprehensive overview of what the script does.
    * Step-by-step instructions on how to use the script, including any required arguments or configuration options.
    * Examples of how the script is typically used in the development workflow.
    * Information about any limitations or error handling to be aware of.
