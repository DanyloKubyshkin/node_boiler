**4. Discussions Focus:**

* **Target a Section:** Clearly outline the specific folder or area of the structure you want to discuss.
* **Questions:** Ask specific questions about organization, naming conventions, or best practice alternatives.
* **Comparisons:** If you have multiple structure options in mind, present them in Markdown for analysis.

**Example:**

> **Let's discuss the 'controllers' folder:**
>
> ```
> * controllers
>   * userController.js
>   * productController.js
>   * orderController.js
> ```
>
> * Should I further group controllers based on functionality (e.g., an 'auth' subfolder)?
> * Is there a better naming convention for large projects?

**Additional Tips:**

* Larger structures might benefit from visualization tools available within some text editors or online ([invalid URL removed]). 
* Consider using **bold** or *italics* to highlight important folders.

**Let's get started! Feel free to share a Markdown representation of your project structure, and we can dive into refining it together.**
