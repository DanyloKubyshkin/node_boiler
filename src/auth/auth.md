# **Purpose**

The `/src/auth` folder houses all components and logic responsible for user authentication and authorization within our application.  It provides a self-contained module to manage user sessions, credentials, permissions, and interactions with external authentication providers (if applicable).

**Contents**

Within this folder, you might find:

* **controllers:**  Handles authentication-specific endpoints like `/login`, `/register`, `/logout`.
* **middleware:** Implements authentication checks, token verification, and authorization logic for protecting routes.
* **models:**  Defines user data structures and any database models related to storing authentication data (e.g., password hashes, refresh tokens).
* **routes:**  Maps Express routes to the relevant authentication controllers.
* **services:**  Encapsulates interactions with external providers like Firebase, Bcrypt, OAuth services, or custom authentication logic.
* **utils:**  Hold helper functions for password hashing, token management, and other common authentication-related tasks.

**Flexibility**

The `auth` folder is designed to accommodate various authentication strategies.  Whether using Firebase, bcrypt, OAuth providers, or a custom solution, this structure promotes modularity and adaptability.

**Security Considerations**

As this folder handles sensitive user data, it's essential to prioritize security best practices. This includes secure password storage, robust token management, and careful design of authorization logic. 

**Let's work together to maintain a secure and user-friendly authentication system within this directory!**
